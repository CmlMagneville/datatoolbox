## Introduction

Bears are in decline [@cowan1972].
     
Here, we investigate the spread and the longevity of bears.  

## Methods  
We used pantheria and wildfinder.   

## Results   

We made some plots. 
```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Fig. 1"}
drake::readd(necoregions_plot)
```

```{r , echo=FALSE, , fig.cap= "Fig. 2"}
drake::readd(gestation_plot)
```
